> Scaffold a pre-configured template which will let you publish vue components to npm very fast/

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible.

### Before You Start...

This boilerplate is targeted at intermediate users who have knowledge of vue and npm modules.
This template makes use of [POI](https://poi.js.org/#/) , [Bili](https://egoist.moe/bili/#/) to bundle the vue component.

## Usage

This is a project template for [sao](https://github.com/saojs/sao).

``` bash
$ yarn global add sao       # Install sao if you haven't already
$ sao cristijora/vue-npm  # Create a new project based on this template
$ cd my-project               # Navigate into your new project folder

$ yarn install  # Install dependencies
$ yarn run dev  # Run development server on port 5000
$ yarn run build # Build your component for production

```

## TODO list
- Include test configurations
- Include eslint support
